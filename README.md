# OHMS-LAW-CALC
This is an Ohms Law Calculator


Recently, I started eletronics. The whole reason I started programming in the first place was the fufil the idea that I could create anythingI wanted 
Mark Zuckenburg was the one who created Facebook because he took the idea someone made and brought it to reality. This goes to show that an idea is only
an idea. So, I have started circuits. 

This code is important because it allowed me to create something very useful in the world of electronics. Ohms law stats that voltage is equal to current x resistence. 
and this program will allow me to find each variable in order to solve these questions when I'm making my projects.
